## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine :

* **Visual Studio 2022** - Download & install Desktop development with C++ workload.

* **JUCE C++ framework** - Download JUCE and Projucer from Github Releases to the main drive C:/.

<br/>

## Tech

* `JUCE and Projucer v7.0.5`
* `JUCE modules`

<br/>

## Run/Debug the project

* Clone repository or download [SegmentDisplayRecognition](SegmentDisplayRecognition.zip) and [SDR2](SDR2.zip) .zip files.
* Extract both `SegmentDisplayRecognition` and `SDR2` to desired location.
* Navigate to JUCE framework directory (`C:/JUCE/`) and run `Projucer.exe`.
* Open `SegmentDisplayRecognition.jucer` and `SDR2.jucer` from extracted files using Projucer.
* Explore solution files in Visual Studio.
* Run both projects using `Local Windows Debugger`.
